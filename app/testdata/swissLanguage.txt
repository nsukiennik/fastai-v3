The Sarine River skirts the edge of Basse-Ville (lower town), dividing both the canton of Fribourg and the city of Fribourg into two sectors: German-speaking and French-speaking. The city of around 40,000 people is clearly one of duality: street signs are all in two languages; residents can choose whether their children will use French or German in primary school; and the university even offers a bilingual curriculum.

However, head to medieval Basse-Ville, caught between the German- and French-speaking divisions of Fribourg, and you’ll find yourself in a no-man's land where the two languages have become one: le Bolze.

Speak to any Swiss national, and you’ll likely find them enthralled with the topic of communication, probably because languages are so incredibly diverse within this small country. The nation can be geographically divided into three major language groups. The south, which shares in the famous lakes of the Swiss-Italian lake region, is Italian-speaking. To the west near Geneva is French-speaking; while central and eastern parts of the country, such as Zurich and St Moritz, rely on German (and the south-eastern canton of Graubünden even includes Romansh speakers).

It gets even more confusing when you throw in the various dialects, such as Franc Comtois, a French dialect spoken in Switzerland’s Jura and Bern cantons; and Swiss German, which is learned at home and only used conversationally (as opposed to ‘proper’ German, which is both written and spoken, and taught at school).

Among all this linguistic complexity, the city of Fribourg/Freiburg (as it’s known in French/German) has the added challenge of lying on the language borders between French- and German-speaking cantons – Vaud and Bern – which is perhaps why it’s home to a people who decided to develop their own language.

As I walked along Fribourg’s main thoroughfare, the first indicator that I was nearing Basse-Ville glided past. From the upper-town terrace that overlooks the Sarine, a historical funicular connects the city centre to Basse-Ville on the riverbank down below. Opened in 1899, the pastel-green ‘Funi’, which is powered by 3,000 litres of water, is the only funicular to run on waste water in Europe. The two-minute ride, which still operates today, is both a symbol of industrial Fribourg and a gateway into the history of the lower town where Bolze was created.

While the exact origins of the language are unknown, many believe that Bolze was created during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th Century, when people began to migrate from the countryside into cities as jobs became available during the industrial boom. As a city bordering both French- and Swiss German-speaking countryside villages, Fribourg grew and expanded into a bilingual, cultural and industrial hub for the poor seeking work.

“Many farmers from the Sense, the region next to Fribourg, came to find a job, and they found cheap living conditions in the Basse-Ville neighbourhood. They thought life would be easier in town,” explained Fribourg tour guide and Bolze expert Michel Sulger.

These workers needed a way to understand one another and work together. So they merged their mother tongues to create a new language.
